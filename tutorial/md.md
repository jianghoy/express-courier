# Markdown

Markdown is a format commonly used in software documentation. Just like its name implies, this is a very straightforward language with little to explain. Yet it's very useful. I intend to maintain a all `.md` bases tutorial folder for future reference and please add every tiny bit of insight into it to make it better for everyone. 

**A well organized tutorial is the most easy way to gain recognition.**
