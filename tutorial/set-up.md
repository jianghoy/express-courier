# Set Up

## Set up backend using IntelliJ Ultimate

### Why Ultimate

TL;DR:

Only IntelliJ Ultimate version supports Spring Framework.

According to JetBrain [comparision matrix](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html), IntelliJ Ultimate contains many useful features from other JetBrain IDEs including features from WebStorm, PyCharm, GoLand, etc. Also it supports Spring, Spring Boot, Angular, React, React Native, TypeScript, and many more frameworks and programming languages.

### How to get IntelliJ Ultimate

Since we are (or were) all students we can use our student account to get a student license from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/). The license will only be valid for one year but that's more than suffice.

## Now I have IntelliJ Ultimate, how to open the backend Spring project

It's a bit more trickier than you think it is, long story short, you must use IntelliJ Ultimate to open the `pom.xml` file in the backend folder for it to appropriately configure all files.
