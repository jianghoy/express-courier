# Temporary doc for Sep.1

## Problem we encounter

1. much slower than everyone's anticipation

2. no communication.

## Solution

1. basic trainings -> use IntelliJ, VS code, Git and Github

2. revise previous projects

3. compulsary working: 7p.m. every day; attend 5 of 7 -> add up to 10 hrs
The basic idea is that if a bunch of people works together 10 hrs per week things may be much easier
